Using Kali Linux open up the Terminal

- Make note of your IP Address by typing in `ip a`
    My ip came up as xxx.x.x.x you think i'd share that with you on here?
      if you're having a hard time finding yours then look for the numbers in the purple text.
      The orange text is your IPV6.  The purple is your IPV4.  You'll want to use the IPV4 for now

- Just for funsies go ahead and ping your ip address.
    You'll see that it's recieving bytes if it's working.  If it's not then maybe check your connections
    and try it again.
      Press the keys CTRL + C to exit the ping session

- Now let's ping the entire network by using Nmap
    type in the command `nmap -sP {insert IP address here}
